Here, I am sharing one of my SQL projects focused on 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀.

In this project, I have utilized data of Restaurant Orders, Order Details, Item Categories, and Sales Transactions to extract valuable insights.

The analysis covers several key areas, including:
- 𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲: Evaluating the restaurant's overall financial performance.
- 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘂 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀: Identifying best-sellers to optimize the menu and pricing.
- 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀: Analyzing orders to tailor offerings based on customer demand.
- 𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀: Optimizing staff scheduling and inventory by identifying peak order times.
- 𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲: Understanding customer spending habits to boost profitability.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to gain actionable insights that drive better decision-making and improve overall restaurant operations.

Happy Querying!

Thank You!
